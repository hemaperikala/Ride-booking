Structure Explanation:

<head> Section: Includes metadata like character encoding, viewport settings, and linking to your CSS file for styling.
<body> Section: Contains the main content of your web page, including input fields for locations, a form for booking, and a container for displaying confirmation messages.
<script> Tag: Links to your JavaScript file (script.js) for handling form submission and displaying confirmation messages.

Content:
Replace "styles.css" and "script.js" with the actual filenames used in your project.
Customize the form labels, button text, and any other content based on your project requirements.

CSS and JavaScript:
Ensure that your styles.css file contains styling rules to make your web application visually appealing and user-friendly.
In your script.js file, implement the logic to handle form submission (submit event listener) and display the confirmation message (innerHTML manipulation).

Testing:
Before committing changes, test your index.html file locally to ensure that it functions correctly.
Ensure all elements are responsive and work as expected on different devices and screen sizes.
